### The user needs an interface to request information about a cocktail from the API and get a response with the related cocktail information.

- Create a React app. ✅
- Clean up the file's initial development. ✅
- Create a form with a "text" input and a "submit" button. ✅
- Create a function to store the input value (useState).✅
- Create a function to fetch the data from the API. ✅
- Store the fetch response (useState). ✅
- print the response to the terminal. ✅

### The interface should display the cocktail name, image and ingredients (min 2).

- Create an element (Cocktail.js) to display the response. ✅
- Provide "props" for the title, the image, and the ingredients. ✅
- build a functionality to filter the ingredient !== NULL, (reduce -> []). ✅
- display each value into a list element (array -> loop). ✅

### The interface should be responsive and consistent with the colours provided from the company.

- Create a color pallet in the CSS (CCS variable) ✅
- Set up Global CSS parameter as the REMs and font style (google fonts). ✅
- Set up classes to target and style: header, main and footer. ✅
- Define the container and implement the initial CSS for the Main element (form - cocktails). ✅

### To improve the usability (initially), the UI should render only a list of drink titles. By clicking on the title, the element extends, showing the hiden information.

- Define containers for title and cocktail information. ✅
- Create two classes -> cocktail-open & cocktail-close. ✅
- Create a state (useState) to store the eventValue. ✅
- Implement onClick (eventValue === objectValue) to conditionaly display the class accordingly. ✅
- Implement a "toggle behaviour " to switch the class between the open and the closed state. ✅
- Reset the input value (useState) to "" for further research. ✅
